## Key Security Practices

### 1. Protecting Data
- **Encryption**: All sensitive information is encrypted during storage and transmission.  
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can access specific features based on their role (e.g., admin, doctor).  

### 2. Secure Login
- Strong passwords are required for all users.  
- Sessions automatically log out after inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.  

### 3. Backups
- Regular data backups are performed to prevent loss.  
- Backups are securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.  

### 4. Safe Development
- Input validation is applied to prevent hacking attempts (e.g., SQL injection).  
- Security patches and updates are applied regularly.  

### 5. Handling Issues
- All activities are logged to detect unusual behavior.  
- Any security issues will be fixed immediately, and users will be informed if necessary.
