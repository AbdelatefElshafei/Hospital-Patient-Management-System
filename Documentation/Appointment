The Appointment class is a Java implementation for managing appointments in a scheduling system. It supports functionalities like scheduling, canceling, rescheduling,
and viewing appointment details, with validations for date and time.

          #`Appointment(int appointmentID, Patient patient, Date date, Date.Time time)`  
Purpose:  
Constructor to initialize an appointment with specific details.

Explanation:  
This method creates a new `Appointment` object by setting the appointment ID, patient, date, and time. It also initializes the `status` attribute to "Scheduled" and displays a confirmation message.



          #`getAppointmentID()`  
Purpose:  
Retrieve the unique ID of the appointment.

Explanation:  
This accessor method returns the `appointmentID`, allowing other components to identify the specific appointment.



          #`setAppointmentID(int appointmentID)`  
Purpose:  
Update the appointment's ID.

Explanation:  
This mutator method allows modifying the `appointmentID` in case the identifier needs to be updated.
